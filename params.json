I've found that IE <= 8 has the annoying tendency to _continue_ ignoring certain media queries in `<link>`ed stylesheets called after the main one.\r\n\r\nSo, I created this jQuery plugin. It calculates the width of the element you apply it to, compares that number to a set of breakpoints (either the default breakpoints or ones you create), and applies a class accordingly).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1.  Load jQuery\r\n2.  Load the plugin\r\n3.  Apply the plugin to an element you wish to measure. (You can apply it to anything on the page, but I use `<body>`: `$('body').rclasses();`\r\n4.  Use the dynamic classes to style your element.\r\n\r\nBy default, there are four classes at four breakpoints. They're pretty arbitrary, though:\r\n* `.rclass-small` (480px)\r\n* `.rclass-medium` (640px)\r\n* `.rclass-large` (960px)\r\n* `.rclass-xlarge` (1200px)\r\n\r\nThat'll get ya started. But if you'd like to use your own breakpoints...\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use your own breakpoints:\r\n```javascript\r\n$('body').rclasses({\r\n\tbreakpoints: {\r\n\t\t'wee': 320,\r\n\t\t'notsowee': 768,\r\n\t\t'freakinhuge': 1200\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n(Classic SNL references optional, but highly recommended.)\r\n\r\nThe keys in the `breakpoint` object will be used as the classes on the `body` element; the values are the pixel-widths at which the plugin begins to apply the classes. (So, in the above example, when the `body` element is between widths of 320 and 768 pixels, it will have a class of 'wee'.) \r\n\r\nYou can also use Modernizr to dynamically load the plugin:\r\n```javascript\r\nModernizr.load([\r\n\t{ // Test for media queries\r\n\t\ttest:\tModernizr.mq('only all'),\r\n\t\tnope:\t'//your-site.com/assets/js/vendor/rclasses.min.js',\r\n\t\tcomplete: function(){\r\n\t\t\t(function($) {\r\n\t\t\t\t$(document).ready(function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(jQuery().rclasses){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$('body').rclasses();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t})(jQuery);\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* The plugin checks the width of _the element you've applied it to_, not the `body` element (unless you applied it to `body`).\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Bug: If multiple instances of the plugin are used, only the last one actually gets new classes on resize.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
